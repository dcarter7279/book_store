# Book Store Application using Tkinter and SQLite3
This is a Python application that allows users to manage a book store's inventory. The application was built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and SQLite3 to store the data.

# Installation
This application requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter library. To install Tkinter, open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

pip install tk

You also need to have the backend.py file in the same directory as frontend.py for the application to work.

# Usage
To start the application, run the frontend.py file using Python. The application window will open, and you will see the following options:

View all: displays a list of all the books in the database.
Search entry: allows the user to search for a specific book in the database using one or more fields (title, author, year, and ISBN).
Add entry: allows the user to add a new book to the database.
Update: allows the user to update the information for a specific book.
Delete: allows the user to delete a book from the database.
Close: closes the application.
When the user selects an option, the corresponding function is called, which interacts with the database through the backend.py module.

# Credits
This application was created by Donell Carter. The original creator of the code is Ardit Sulce.
